Let us pull the dataset from the file `spotify_dataset.csv` into a dataframe `df_spotify`. As this file is huge in size, we cannot upload it on GitHub. Thus, we are storing the file in a folder called `spotify_dataset` that is located in one folder above the project folder.

```{r Pulling the Data}
df_spotify <- data.frame(read.csv('spotify_dataset.csv'))
str(df_spotify)
```


```{r}

head(df_spotify)
tail(df_spotify)
```

```{r}
summary(df_spotify)

```

First, let's check the percentage of NA's present in each columns of the dataset.

```{r Checking NAs}
(colMeans(is.na(df_spotify)))*100
```


```{r Popularity Distribution Graph}
ggplot(df_spotify, aes(x = popularity, fill=popularity)) +
    geom_bar()
```


```{r Danceability Distribution Graph}
ggplot(df_spotify, aes(x = danceability, fill=danceability)) +
    geom_bar()
```
